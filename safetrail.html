            <p>In week four of Designing Interactions I changed teams to evaluate SafeTrail, a data communication
                and visualization tool created by another team during the first part of the course. SafeTrail began as
                a data tracking wristband that hikers would wear during strenuous treks. The device records and
                relays vital data (heart rate, emotional status, etc.) to the guide so they can monitor and adjust the
                trek to the needs of the hikers. After the hike, participants could order a custom memorabilia item
                featuring a visualization of their data. The team decided to focus on this customized visualization of
                adventure data.</p>
                <br>
            <p>Our first task as the evaluation team was constructing a plan for the following three weeks. We split
                our research plan into qualitative and quantitative methods to better organize our activities. The
                quantitative team built a questionnaire with the goal of reaching 30+ active people and gaining
                insights into general feelings about data visualization and memorabilia. The qualitative team planned
                an interview script including an activity with the Figma prototype and booked times with five
                participants of various demographics and sports levels.</p>
            <br>  
            <p>The interviews were conducted remotely using Zoom and Figma with one person acting as the
                interviewer and two people taking notes. After the interviews, we gathered all relevant data onto a
                prepared Miro board along with the data from the questionnaire. This data will be used to do an
                Affinity Mapping exercise with the whole team to pull out themes and insights. These discoveries will
                then be presented in a report at the end of the class.</p>
            <br>
            <p>My Role: For SafeTrail, I developed the questionnaire for our quantitative evaluation, took the lead in
                the interview evaluations, and synthesized the data from our quantitative questionnaire. I was actively
                involved in all aspects of evaluation, including Affinity Mapping.</p>

            <p id="bold">This project was evaluated by a team of seven students during the second half of Designing
                Interactions with Antti Salovaara and Andr√©s Lucero for Aalto University in Spring 2021.</p>
