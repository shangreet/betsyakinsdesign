            <p>This project began by using Kendon's concept of F-formations to observe human behavior in public
                spaces. My team observed Kamppi during three time slices; 11:00, 17:00, and 23:00. We used our
                observations in a Google Design Sprint to define a focus area and develop a product. Our chosen topic
                was personal space and power dynamics.</p>
                <br>
            <p>Our concept, Solu, was a complete interactive system that includes auditory, visual, and tactile
                elements. It is designed to be implemented in public spaces where visitors have to wait, such as public
                transit stations which include shopping options. It includes three linked features, the first being an
                interactive touchscreen map of the area which can indicate which areas are more densely populated
                and guide visitors to a quiet area. The second feature is interactive personal circle lights which can be
                activated and manipulated to convey a desire to be left alone. When occupied, these circles relay
                information to the map about how occupied that area is. The final feature is a responsive sound
                system that adjusts ambient background noise levels based on information from the circles and map to
                set sound levels to a calm, relaxing state.</p>
            <br>  
            <p>After the Google Design Sprint we decided to do a vertical prototype and focus on the interactive light
                circle element. This element was the most interesting to our evaluators because of the embodied
                method of interaction. We did a rough prototype of the interaction in Figma before handing it over to
                the evaluation team.</p>
            <br>
            <p>My Role: Communication expert - during these three weeks I organized and conducted evaluation
                interviews, planned concise and informative reports, and presented our work to the class. I personally
                created the storyboards which acted as the narrative behind our prototype.</p>
            <br>
            <p id="bold">This project was created by a team of five students during the first half of Designing Interactions with
                Antti Salovaara and Andr√©s Lucero at Aalto University in Spring 2021.</p>
