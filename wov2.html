            <p>In February 2015, I co-founded a Facebook group with one other person called Women of Vienna. It
                started as a longing for a community that offered support, connectivity, and the opportunity to make
                friendships. We were soon asked to organize in-person events, the first of which 40 women attended.
                Our events became so popular that we took on a third team member to help us with administrative
                tasks and hosting.</p>
                <br>
            <p>For me, it was clear from the very beginning that we would have to concretely define our values and
                goals to keep the community from developing into something we did not want. This meant sticking to
                those values and goals even when it was difficult, while at the same time maintaining an open mind
                and a sense of flexibility. My main role was defining the guidelines under which the group functioned
                and developing a concrete identity for the community. Soon, recurring themes started to appear and I
                developed a model for topic subgroups, or smaller themed communities.</p>
            <br>  
            <p>Five years later, we reached over 20,000 members in our main group and 11 topical subgroups led
                by a team of 25+ volunteers. Our non-profit organization status was officially recognized by the
                governing body in Vienna in 2019. We became beta testers for new Facebook Groups features and
                one of our team was a part of a development group run by Facebook. We built a visual language to
                accompany the brand of Women of Vienna and began to focus more on our public facing
                representation of the community.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The most valuable lessons I learned from developing and leading this group include; how to work
                with an incredibly diverse team, how to hack an existing platform (Facebook) to fit individual needs,
                and how to keep the big picture in mind when focusing on details. Today I am immensely proud of
                Women of Vienna, the lives it has changed and the good it has done. It has shown me that being
                intentional, consistent, and persistent is the best way to build a quality product.</p>

            <p id="bold">Women of Vienna was initiated in February 2015 by Betsy Akins and Michelle Hrvat. It was
                recognized as an official non-profit organization in 2019.</p>
