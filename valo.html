            <p>vALO is a project created for Product Architecture Design at Aalto University which was
                then submitted to the Luminord 2020 competition. We were one of eight teams chosen out
                of hundreds for the final round of the competition. Unfortunately, because of COVID-19, my
                team was not able to physically prototype vALO and had to withdraw from the competition.</p>
                <br>
            <p>vALO is an interactive lighting fixture that allows for adjustment in height and intensity of
                light. Its simple geometric shape allows it to find a home in any classroom or space. It comes
                in a wide range of colors inspired by the play of natural light on the lakes and in the forests
                of Finland. vALO is easy to assemble and disassemble, making it exciting to explore. Made
                out of primarily recycled plastics, it creates a teaching opportunity on the topic of
                sustainability.</p>
            <br>  
            <p>vALO allows for three variations in light distribution. When the ball is lifted fully, it rests
                inside the shade and a soft light glows through the shade. When the ball is partially lowered,
                light is dispersed both through the shade and around the ball, creating a more intense level of
                light. When the ball is in the lowest position, light is distributed and reflected from the ball
                into the room for the highest level of intensity.</p>
            <br>
            <p>My Role: This team and project was my absolute favorite at Aalto. I was the researcher,
                diving deep into the background information and pulling out the expertise from our
                interviews. This project highlighted my ability to pull together different interest areas into a
                unique concept.</p>
            <br>
            <p id="bold">This project was created by a three person student team for Product Architecture Design with Severi
                Uusitalo at Aalto University in Spring 2020.</p>
